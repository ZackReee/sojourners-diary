# Sojourners' Diary

## Abstract
Modern society’s fast-paced lifestyle calls for a modern solution in managing and tracking the tasks / deadlines & priorities that individuals have in a smart and efficient manner. With so many tasks, things to do, needs and wants, tracking each in different places can become a hastle. To turn that hastle into haste, why not have a platform that keeps track of everything, including your deadlines, appointments and even the release of the new triple A game that you have been saving up for. The plan is simple, develop a smart diary managing system.

## Software Requirements
The software should follow the MVC architecture and built in python. It should utilize a database that stores a user’s tasks and miport from a UI library in python for developing the software’s GUI. Users need to keep track of their tasks/deadlines in an efficient manner so common features such as setting deadlines and priorities for tasks needs to be present. Data structures should also be used alongside sorting and/or searching algorithms to help users orient their tasks in a way that makes it meaningful for the user. The software should also support different widgets, such as a calendar that composes of all the recorded entries of the user.
